## Getting started

1.  **Project setup.**

    Navigate into this site’s directory and install dependencies

    ```shell
    npm i
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Start the development server

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

    The site should be running at http://localhost:8000!

## Deployment

This portfolio is actually deployed as a static site on **Github Pages**. A continuous deployment pipeline (CD 🚀) is triggered on `push` by a Github action. This action bundles the sources as ready-to-serve built assets and then deploys generated files.
